# GreenLit Practice Repository

This is where I share my weekly practice work for the GreenLit program at App Academy. I really enjoy coding every day, and this repo helps me stay consistent while learning how to build clean, reliable web applications from both the frontend and backend.

## Folder Structure

- All practice work is organized by week


Each folder contains daily exercises, coding challenges, and code I did for job applications.

## About Me

I'm a full-stack engineer trained through App Academy’s immersive hands-on program , I have experience in:

- React, Redux, Flask, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- Authentication and authorization logic
- Deployment workflows (Render, seed/migration audits)
- UI/UX polish and instructor-grade presentation
- Debugging with DevTools and Redux state management

I code at least once per day and use this repository to track my consistency. I find coding deeply rewarding and enjoy refining my engineering skills through daily practice.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A personal tracker for weekly GreenLit assignments
- A portfolio of disciplined, instructor-aligned code
- A way to show how I’m improving my skills and staying focused on quality work

## Long-Term Goal

My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer who builds secure, scalable applications across both frontend and backend systems. I'm especially interested in working on projects that integrate AI tools and services. I am very interested in designing the infrastructure and user experiences that make intelligent features possible.




Feel free to explore the folders and follow my journey as I build toward enterprise-grade engineering roles.
